      There once was alan who woke up and got a messege from his girlfriend.
      He's in this relation for about three months and now he has started
      thinking his girlfriend is too crazy. He remembers some of the stuff she
      did. Then alan goes to school stuff. His girlfiriend is shown and her
      behavious. She is just too loving person but alan thinks she's a
      psychopath cause it seems like that for some reason. In reality his
      girlfriend is too obsessed with him. Then another girl is seen. He's alans
      first crush. For her sake alan breaks up and tries hooking up with her but
      his ex is too obsessed with him. She won't let him go. Then after a long
      story or a short story alan finally secures a date with his crush and he
      decided to propose to her. Note that it won't be their first date since
      his crazy ex is there to inturupt and keep the story going for a while and
      build up the charecter backstory.

      Now the female side backstory is revealed. She loves alan cause of his
      smile. She made her smile once and ever since that she's in love with him.
      The same reason alan likes his crush cause she once smiled and he thinks
      that it was cute. Alan decided to go on a date white being tired of
      stopping alan his crazy girlfriend just cries alone. She then goes
      outside. On alan's side he got rejected and he came back to his gf which
      he didn't. He was just passing by but since his emotions were disrupted he
      was pulled in by his crazy ex. They talk about why they love who they love
      and his crazy gf asks alan to marry him insted. Alan says that it would be
      a lie. His crazy gf explains that she doesn't cares. At first it would be
      a bit hard to stay together but they'll fall in love eventually. Alan
      accepts that and turns out she made a cake for him to make up their break
      up. She hugs alan but the next scean she's hugging a pillow. She has a cut
      in her hands.

      Turns out the entire sceaneario that alan got rejected and he came back
      was the imagination of the crazy gf. Alan actually got accepted by the
      proposal to his crush and they posted this on facebook. His crazy gf saw
      that and put her phone beside the cake she was preparing thinking alan
      would come back. This final scean will go like this. She was hugging alan
      but it then turned into pillow. Then she would start crying looking at her
      hand. Then the table in the dining room is seen where the knife is which
      is used to cut her hand and the cake which she was preparing and most
      importatly the post where both alan and his crush can be seen with the
      ring symbolizing that she suicided cause alan got accepted to a marrage
      proposal. The screen turns black as the audince seeks answers of what
      happend.
